                        <p>At the University of the West Indies, finding the right apartment is extremely difficult and time-consuming since many apartments are not advertised, outside of walking distance and not secure. Additionally, landlords are difficult to contact and featured landlords are simply unpleasant . Students must take great care and effort to locate an apartment that fits within their budget and level of comfort.</p>

									This task will take about 10 minutes or more. These ratings are important and will be a filter for the student to choose from, when browsing for apartments. For the virtual tours, users will be able to see the apartment before going to visit. This will help them narrow down their search and time as they will not have to drive around and check every available apartment. For the maps, there will be the walking and driving distance to U.W.I, where the user can zoom anywhere on the map due to google maps being used. If they wish to, they can view the maps on full screen.
