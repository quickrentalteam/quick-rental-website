							<h1 class="mb-10">Description of brainstorming process</h1>
							<p>Our group conducted the brainstorming process at UWI in the computer lab on Wednesday 7th November. We drew four designs each, as well as some extra designs. In total we got 18 design sketches and 9 groups/tasks which included; Browse/Filter, Apartment Details, Apartment Listing, Login, Sign-Up, Reviews, Notifications, Bookmarks, and Add/Register Apartment. The materials we used to draw our sketches were printing paper, rulers, pencils and pens. We then discussed each of our ideas, it’s strengths and weakness and how it would suit the application. Furthermore, we grouped all the realted design sketches to their respective tasks into an Affinity diagram, as shown below. </p>

									<h1 class="mb-10">Thoughts on the Brainstorming Process</h1>
									<p>It was extremely fun to actually draw our designs instead of designing them on a program like adobe XD. It made us bond more as a group and grow as a team. We got a look at other people's originality and creativity. We all thought of different designs. We learnt that it's essential to work in a team when building projects. We got to see the diverse ideas and mindsets and it was a great experience as each member had input that other members did not think of. It opened us up to think differently. </p>

								<h3>Browse and Filter</h3>
								<br>
								<h5>Description</h5>
								<p> <br>
									Filter - The browse feature of the mobile application was said to have the filters; price, location and amenities (furnished, unfurnished, studio, shared, co-ed, same sex, utilities included, A/C, parking availability, pet allowed, nearby facilities). On clicking ‘Browse’, the user would be taken to a filter page where they would enter their preferred apartment criteria. Four designs for the ‘browse’ task was made where they varied a bit. All had the filters mentioned above and 2/4 had a reset and save button.
									<br><br>
									Browse -For apartment details. When the user clicks on an apartment, they are taken to the apartment details page for that apartment. They can see all the details, view the map of the apartment, enter a virtual tour of the apartment, see the reviews left for the apartment and contact the landlord.
								</p>
								<h5>Usage</h5>
								<p>
									Filter - The user would choose their price range and location, check all of the boxes for the amenities they wish to have in an apartment and select their roommates gender preference. Next they would click ‘Browse’, which would take the user to the list of apartments that fits the criteria selected.
									<br><br>
									Browse - The user would click on an apartment and view the details of that apartment. They would click on 'Tour' button to enter a virtual tour, click on the 'Map' button to view the map of the apartment, and click on the 'Reviews' button to see the overall and individual reviews left by previous renters. Furthermore, they would click on 'Call Landlord', or 'Message Landlord' to call or send an SMS to the landlord, or they can click on 'Direct Message' to chat with the landlord via a messenger platform.
								</p>
								<h5>Strengths</h5>
								<p> <br>
									All designs were user-friendly. The buttons were placed conveniently, and the form attributes were appropriate for the filters mentioned. E.g. a range was used for price and checklist options were used for amenities. One design used icons which made the filter page clearer.
								</p>
								<h5>Weaknesses</h5>
								<p> <br>
									It increases the number of actions that the user must perform.
								</p>
								<h5>Feasibility</h5>
								<p> <br>
									Due to the high level of documentation and tutorials online, it is quick and efficient to implement this.
								</p>
								<h5>Originality</h5>
								<p> <br>
									It is a tried and true method and thus, known to be very reliable and user-friendly, based on countless user reports.

									<h3>Apartment Listing</h3>
									<br>
									<h5>Description</h5>
									<p> <br>
										A list of all the filtered apartments is shown. This is part of the browse task, where after entering all filters and clicking ‘Browse’, a page of all the apartments with the selected filters are shown. We had no design for the in assignment 2. Two varied designs were made for this group. They both had the same functionality and details such as putting the photo of the apartment along with the price. One was a grid view and the other were a list view.
									</p>

									<h5>Usage</h5>
									<p>
										The user would browse through the apartments given from their specified criteria. Each listing would have a slideshow of photos of the apartment, the rating, and the main features. There would also be a bookmark button if the user wishes to save the apartment to view at a later time. Once the user discovers an apartment they would like to know more about, they would click on the listing which would take them to the apartment details page for that specific apartment. Thus, they would see the full features of the apartment, the map provided by google maps, reviews, and would be able to enter a virtual tour.

									</p>
									<h5>Strengths</h5>
									<p> <br>
										Both designs were user-friendly. The list view was more concise, while the grid view had a user-friendly task bar. Therefore, we decided to merge both designs into one, where we would use the list view with the task bar from the grid view. An icon to see the review and bookmark the apartment was also drawn for quick and easy bookmark. The user would be able to see the review, photos and main features one time. Furthermore, the images provided are a slideshow where the user can easily see all the pictures without clicking on the apartment.
									</p>
									<h5>Weaknesses</h5>
									<p> <br>
										One a mobile application, only one row of an apartment is shown. Thus, if the user wishes to scroll through 100’s of apartments, it would be very tedious unless they view the web site.
									</p>
									<h5>Feasibility</h5>
									<p> <br>
										Code re-use is very beneficial here, because it is widely used.
									</p>
									<h5>Originality</h5>
									<p> <br>
										It is a tried and true method and thus, known to be very reliable and user-friendly, based on countless user reports.

										<h3>Reviews - Viewing and Leaving a Review</h3>
										<br>
										<h5>Description</h5>
										<p> <br>
											The reviews feature of the mobile application was not discussed in detail in terms of design before. Two designs for this group was made. One was the review page and the other was to write a review. The functionality of the designs was made based on the review task in assignment 2.
										</p>
										<h5>Usage</h5>
										<p>
											The user would be able to see the overall rating, the number of users that selected one to five out of five stars for the rating and why, and the actual responses about the apartment by users. They would be able to downvote or upvote the review and also reply to it. They can also post a review by clicking on ‘New Review’. This would take them to a post review page, where they can leave their review and upload photos as evidence.
	
										</p>
										<h5>Strengths</h5>
										<p> <br>
											The review page seemed very user-friendly as there was the name and photos of the apartment, the overall review, the number of users who put one star to five stars, and the actual written review by users. The post review page allowed photos and a selection for the stars. It was concise and simple, and was thus, user-friendly.
										</p>
										<h5>Weaknesses</h5>
										<p> <br>
											Pagination was not considered for the review page at the time of the design, but was included after.
										</p>
										<h5>Feasibility</h5>
										<p> <br>
											Code re-use is very beneficial here, because it is widely used.
										</p>
										<h5>Originality</h5>
										<p> <br>
											It is a tried and true method and thus, known to be very reliable and user-friendly, based on countless user reports.

								<h4 class="about-title mb-10">What went well?</h4>
									<p><span>We learnt many new frameworks like ionic and react and learnt a lot about how these systems interact and are integrated. The design process was enjoyable, and we would do it again for any project we decide to do. It was also useful to see what other people like to see, as well as learning the intricacies of coding the different designs.</span>
									</p>
								<h4 class="about-title mb-10">What went poorly?</h4>
									<p><span><b>Time management and attempting to do too much at once.</b> While future proofing is beneficial, thinking too far ahead can learn to burnout and become overwhelming when one attempts to do too much at once and account for everything. It is also important to have a detailed plan for a Minimal Viable Product (MVP), to ensure that there is no unnecessary effort and time spent.</span>
									</p>
								<h4 class="about-title mb-10">What would we do differently?</h4>
									<p><span><li>
											A more organized division of labour, so members of the group can contribute more based on their expertise and interests. 
									</li>
									<li>
											Properly detail a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) so we know not to go overboard and get carried away with the little details.
