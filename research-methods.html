								<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
								<br>
								<h5>Justification</h5>
								<p> <br>
									We decided to conduct secondary research firstly, as it will help us know what to do for our primary research. It can define our target customers and those that would be loyal, as well as give insight into customer preference and information on how to draw them. It can help us discover the current trends in the market and what are customers thoughts on the product. Furthermore, the estimate type and costs required for the primary research can be found.
								</p>
								<h5>Method Description</h5>
									<p> <br>
										We researched apartment rental applications already built internationally, as well as locally, and read on the customer feedback and features that the current applications have as well as what customers think is missing. We also discovered a few research past papers that discussed the need for apartment rental applications and what features are most important.
									</p>
								<h5>Major Findings</h5>
									<p>
										<br>
										At the University of the West Indies (UWI), there is a shortage of off-campus, student friendly housing, and what exists is poorly advertised. This puts rentals near UWI at a high and constant demand. Landlords exploit this and rent apartments at ludicrously high prices. Thus, presently, locating an apartment near UWI is an exhaustive task and very time consuming. <br><br>
										There are many apartment rental mobile applications made for international countries. For example, PadMapper, which allows users to search apartments in a specific city or country. It uses Google Maps and allows users to register an apartment via their address. There’s also Housing.com, 99acres, MagicBrick, Abodo, Apartments.com, Apartment Guide, Coldwell Banker and many more. These can be used to buy a new property, virtually explore the city or country for an apartment, provides 3D and 360o tours, videos and photos for most listing, which is a feature we will be implementing. (Dailey et al. 2018). The reviews are over 4/5 for these applications where users have said that it is easy to use and locate apartments. The main complaint was that it was not within a users’ country. Another complaint, for apartments.com was that most of the apartments listing were scams (Audrey 2018). <br><br>
										Consignado and others found that an apartment rental mobile application is important and needed. They also saw that there are many apartment rental applications, but none for their country. They emphasized how time consuming locating an apartment can be. Thus, they created HAYBOL. HAYBOL a system that eases the hunting of apartments for students and employees in the Philippines. They use Google maps for the location and position, shows if the apartment is registered and has information like the landlord’s contact information, visit reservation, monthly rent, complete address and so on. They received a rating of 3.55 overall which was verbally-interpreted as excellent. (Consignado et al. 2017). <br><br>
										However, all these systems are international and do not fix our problem with finding apartments near UWI. Upon further research, we found a website, Oasis.com, that helps UWI students locate apartments. You can enter the price range, preferred area and desired number of occupants. This result shows the availability, accommodation, desired gender, number of occupants, price, landlords contact and location as well as facilities and utilities included. However, it is not possible to search by this criteria and many of the listings are out-of-date. They also created a map navigator to show the location of the apartment. ("Online Accommodation Student Information System." 2018). However, our application will contain much more functionality; criteria to select from, will be in the form of an app and viewed easily on the web as well, so you can easily search on your phone if you are on the go, will contain videos and virtual tours, reviews of the apartment and a messaging platform to the landlord.<br><br>
										This research demonstrated the need for an apartment rental app for UWI students, as even though many applications are done, it is for international countries, not suitable or outdated and does not have all the features the students need to make their search less stressful.

								<h3>Surveys for the Students/Employees</h3>
								<br>
								<h5>Justification</h5>
								<p> <br>
									We decided to distribute the surveys to students only via Google forms because students would explain themselves more on the survey rather than face to face interaction while, most landlords would explain themselves with face to face interviews. Additionally, the survey will help us gain quantitative as well as qualitative results since close ended and open-ended questions were used. It was very easy to distribute around to University of the West Indies (UWI) students as well as google forms visualize the results in charts, which makes the data easy to summarize. The environment is also non-intimidating and not evasive, where the user can comfortably answer in their home using their mobile phones. The information received is also objective since it’s unbiased as users don’t feel the need to answer a certain way as if they were asked directly.

								</p>
								<h5>Method Description</h5>
									<p> <br>
										We created a survey with two sections via google forms. The first section discovers what users look for in an apartment and what is preferred. This will help us put more focus on the specific factors chosen e.g. location within the app. The second section aimed to discover if the user ever used an apartment rental app and their experience with it, so we can ensure we build our app to cater to their needs and ensure that it is better than ones out there. Moreover, this section aimed to discover if the app is needed and what features the user would like to see within the app. So far, we got 48 participants.

												<h6>Full Results to this survey can be found in the embedded Google Spreadsheet
												<a href="results.html">here</a>.</h6>
										</p>
									</p>

									</p>
								<br> <br>
								<h5>Major Findings</h5>
									<p>
										<br>
										The age group that mostly replied were 18-21 (<strong>58.3%</strong>). We found out that the major factors involved in choosing an apartment are price, furnished apartments,utilities inclusive, air-conditioning and security with price being the leading factor. The price range mostly desired is $2200-$2500 (<strong>20.8%</strong>). Respondents that previously use an apartment rental app claimed that the apartment was not as advertised because the telephone number for the landlord was incorrect on the app. Location, price and safety were found to be the hardest part when choosing an apartment as almost all users do not find what there are looking for.
											<br><br>
										Users (<strong>83.3%</strong>) normally find apartments by word of mouth and respondents claimed that the methods that currently exist for finding apartment are newspaper and social media. The major problem found with these current methods are that there are no pictures, it is time consuming, not accurately advertised, unreliable information, stressful and no updates about the availability of the apartment.
										<br><br>
										Features most respondents wanted were a rating on the landlord and roommates.
										<br><br>
										<strong>97.9%</strong> of respondents said that they would prefer to browse apartments on an app and 100% stated that they would love to see reviews for the apartments. Furthermore, 91.7% stated that it would be useful to have a virtual tour of the apartment on the app, and all users said they would most likely use the app and recommend it to friends and family. 
										<br><br>
										To conclude, it is very clear that UWI students have major problems and stress when locating an apartment. It was also very evident than everyone would prefer to use an apartment rental application and that our solution would save UWI students from a great deal of stress.

								<h3>Interviews for the Landlords</h3>
								<br>
								<h5>Justification</h5>
								<p> <br>
									We decided to conduct interviews with the landlords particularly mainly because it is difficult to distribute our surveys to them. Our surveys already obtained qualitative data and the respondents were very vocal with their opinions where we gained a deeper understanding of the problem and our solution. Thus, it was not needed to interview the students. The interviews with landlords would help us gain insight on the landlords’ opinions about an apartment rental app. The landlords are a very important stakeholder for our apartment rental application as without them, we would have no apartments to browse within the app. Thus, it was necessary to investigate the issues with them in detail via interviews. Interviews would also aid us in discovering the usefulness and effectiveness of an apartment rental app and would allow us to deeper understand statistical data. 

								</p>
								<h5>Method Description</h5>
									<p> <br>
										We created ten open ended questions for our interviews with the landlords and conducted both phone interviews and face to face interviews. It was extremely difficult to get a hold of landlords in such a short space of time. Many of them were rude and had no time for us. Most of them did not live within the apartment, thus we had to conduct phone interviews as well. To get into contact with the landlords, those within our group that rents, contacted their landlords, and we contacted the rest through friends as well as found their contacts online, in which we set up a time to meet for the interview. So far we got <strong>4</strong> participants due to the difficulties mentioned.
									</p>
								<h5>Major Findings</h5>
									<p>
										<br>
										According to our interviews conducted, the landlords agreed that price and location are major factors. However, as the semester continues and many places are snatched up, these factors become less important and students make compromises. It was discovered that all respondents used social media and word-of-mouth to advertise their apartments. This is because they do no have the time or choose not to dedicate it to advertising their apartments, simply because the demand is so large. They suggested that if the app promotes their business and reduces inconveniences as claimed, it will be utilised. However, there were mixed feelings concerning reviews. Two respondents (50%) claimed that while good reviews will further their business, they were concerned of the impact of bad reviews from tenants who faced valid criticism and complaints, such as for noise and visitors, as well as those who were removed for non-payment. 
										<br><br>
										<i>To account for the possibility of malicious reviews, confirmation from both parties will be required (from landlord and tenant). It is reasonable that tenants who fail to meet payments, and face multiple complaints may no longer be allowed to leave reviews.</i>

								On conducting secondary research, many mobile applications for apartment rental applications were found, thus, the reviews were looked at and taken as findings on what people look for in an application like this. This also helped us decide on the questions to ask for our surveys. However, only one research article was found on an apartment rental application, thus not much to reference. <br><br>
								
								<h4 class="about-title mb-10">Surveys</h4>
								On conducting surveys, we did not run into any problems as the surveys were successful. Within 3 days we got 48 responses, the students were also very opinionated for the open ended questions, giving us greater insight and qualitative analysis, as well as quantitative, into the problem and our solution. <br><br>
								
								<h4 class="about-title mb-10">Interviews</h4>
								On conducting the interviews with the landlords, we had a few problems as there wasn’t enough time to conduct interviews with many landlords. Landlords are working full time and are very busy. We contacted many of them but some of the were rude saying that the don’t have time and others did not live near the compound. Many landlords did not want to cooperate.
							The solve this, we would need more time to collect data due to the difficulty of setting up meetings with landlords who are normally busy working. <br><br>

							<h4 class="about-title mb-10">What would we do differently?</h4>
							A longer time period is needed for initial data collection therefore more data will be collected over time until a certain amount is reached. This will help us assess the problem and solution in better detail and help us know what the customer wants/needs. 
							After data collection, we would meet with users/stakeholders after every increment of the product is built and get their feedback to develop the product the way the users want to. 
							Also, we would offer an incentive such as free advertisement to the landlord in return for their cooperation.</span>
